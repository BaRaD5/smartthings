# Talk to Alexa
This parent/child SmartApp creates virtual momentary button tiles which, when activated via another SmartApp or a routine, use a text-to-speech device to issue a command to your Amazon Echo.


## Installation
Install both SmartApps as well as the customized Momentary Button Tile device type.  Publish the device type and the parent (Talk to Alexa) SmartApp for yourself.  The child SmartApp (Alexa TTS Command) need not be published.
